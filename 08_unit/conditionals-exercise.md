#### Let's get started!


This exercise may be familiar to some of you — your job is to write some code that, depending on the value of `x`, assigns one of several values to `result`:

1. If `x` is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (for example, 15 or 30), set `result` to `"fizzbuzz"`.
2. Otherwise if `x` is evenly divisible by 3 (for example, 3, 6, or 9), set `result` to `"fizz"`.
3. Otherwise if `x` is evenly divisible by 5 (for example, 5 or 10), set `result` to `"buzz"`.
4. If `x` is not evenly divisible by either 3 or 5 (for example, 7), set `result` to `x`.


> Don't remember how to determine if something divides evenly? Review the modulus (`%`) operator.

To test your code, set a value for `x` in the "JavaScript" panel and click "Run" in the "Console" panel. Then type the variable name `result` into the "Console" panel and hit the enter/return key. Did you get the result you expected? Try out several different values for `x`, just to be sure.
