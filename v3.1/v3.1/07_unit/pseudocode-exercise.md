### Pseudocode Exercise

***

#### Instructions

Now it's your turn to practice writing pseudocode!

Try your hand at writing pseudocode for this program. Remember, the goal is to think through the problem and break it down into simple steps.

You can use a pen and paper or a text editor to complete this exercise.

#### Let's get started!

We'd like to create a program that checks to see whether or not movie patrons are eligible for a discount and then displays the appropriate ticket price.

Here is the pricing structure:

1) If patrons are 65 or older, they are eligible for senior discounts. The ticket price for seniors is $6.00.

2) If patrons are 25 or younger, they are eligible for student discounts. The ticket price for students is $8.00.

3) All other tickets cost $10.00.
