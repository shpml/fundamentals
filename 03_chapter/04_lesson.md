#HTML Elements

Now, let's get back to some HTML!

HTML doesn't understand the spaces and line breaks in your code. That's why element tags can help out! **Elements** are what provide structure to your website. They consist of an **opening** and **closing tag** and the content in between. The tags tell the browser what kind of content it's dealing with. For example, an opening header tag (`<h1>`) and closing header tag (`<\h1>` )tag tell the browser that it needs to render a header of some sort in a specified size. More to learn in the video below!

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/sz0luvgytl?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

#### Checkpoint:

* Which heading tag is larger? `<h3` or `<h6>`?
* What is the default name for homepages on the web?
* How should you save your html file?
* How do you create placeholder for a link?
