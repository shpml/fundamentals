## ![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Part 1:

1) Open up your terminal application.

2) Navigate into your `Downloads` directory.

3) Move the `World` directory you downloaded in the previous exercise from `Downloads` to your home directory.

4) Check to see if you've successfully moved the `World` directory by listing the contents of your home directory.

---

Part 2:

You may have noticed that we neglected to include Antarctica in the `World` directory. Go ahead and correct this mistake straight from the command line:

1) Make sure you're in the `World` directory within your home directory.

2) Make a new directory titled `Antarctica` inside the `World` directory.

3) To be sure you created the directory in the right place, list the contents of the `World` directory.

4) If you haven't already, navigate back into the `World` directory.

5) List the contents of `South_America`. There should be three country directories: Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

7) Move the contents of `South_America` into the `North_America` folder.

8) Delete the now empty `South_America` directory.

9) Change the name of the `North_America` folder to `Americas`.

---

Part 3:
Close and restart your terminal application.

1) In your command line, navigate to your home directory.

2) Print your working directory to confirm your location.

3) List the contents of the `Americas` folder without changing your working directory (HINT: Use an absolute path).

4) In your home directory, create a new folder called "wdi-fundamentals."

5) Change the name of the `wdi-fundamentals` folder to "fundamentals." Do not change its location.

6) We'll be using this folder to house your Fundamentals project, so keep it clean and don't delete it!
