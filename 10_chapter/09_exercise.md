Below is the starter code for your next exercise.

In this exercise we're going to practice manipulating the DOM by updating our Reading List site, which is a little outdated.

For now, we'll run our JavaScript to update the DOM when the page loads. In the next lesson we'll take a look at how we can update the page based on the user's actions. Maybe we'll add a list item when the user clicks on a button. Or maybe we'll remove a list item when the user clicks on an 'X' icon.


###Instructions

1. Let's get started! Some starter code has been provided in jsfiddle for this exercise.
2. Write the code to perform the actions listed below in the 'js' panel.
3. Click 'run' to see the results in the 'result' panel.

**Let's get started!**

* Use the `querySelectorAll()` method to select all elements that have the `current` class. Using array syntax (our trusty square brackets), find the second element that has the `current` class and update the text content to "Me Talk Pretty One Day".

* Use the `getElementById()` method to find the element that has the id `next`. We want to add a link to this book so we can purchase it. Change the inner HTML of this element to include an anchor: `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flamethrowers-Rachel-Kushner/dp/1439142017/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458897183&sr=8-1&keywords=the+flamethrowers">The Flamethrowers</a>`

* Find the first `li` using the `querySelector()` method. Change the inner HTML to `The Wind Up <strong>Bird</strong> Chronicle`.

* Find the fourth list item using the `querySelectorAll()` method. Change the text to "I'm the fourth!"

* Use the `getElementsByTagName` method to select all `<li>` elements. Then use a for loop to iterate through these elements and change the text content to "JavaScript rules!".

* Use the `getElementsByClassName` method to select all elements that have the `current` class. Then use array syntax to select the first item from that class and change the inner HTML to "Manipulating the DOM is fun!"
