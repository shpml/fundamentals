Time to give it a whirl! In this exercise you'll be getting some practice setting up and updating a contacts array. Later in this unit we'll be adding some complexity and creating a more robust contact book that allows us to store more detailed information, add new contacts, list contacts, and search contacts by first or last name.

Instructions

1. Open a new session in [repl.it](https://repl.it/).
2. Write the code to perform the actions listed below, using repl.it's editor window.
3. Click 'play' to run the code.
4. Call each function from the console window. Try using different parameters to make sure they're working properly.

### Let's get started!

* Create an array `contacts`. This array should contain the names "Matt Smith", "Sam Davis", and "Ashley Jones".
* Create a function `findContact`, which accepts one parameter, `index`. It should return the contact at that `index`.
* Create a function `addContact`, which accepts one parameter, `name`. It should add that name to the end of the contacts array and return the contacts array.
* Create a function `updateLastContact`, which accepts one parameter, `newName`. It should update the last contact in the contacts array with the `newName` and return the contacts array.

Once you're satisfied with the way things are working, feel free to move on to the next lesson. **Be sure to save your repl.it session and keep your link as you'll be using it again for another exercise in this unit.**
