#Manipulating the DOM

Now that you've practiced accessing and updating the DOM, let's take a look at some more advanced methods that allow us to update content and styles.

### Adding Content
####**`createElement()` and `appendChild()`**

To add new elements to a web page, we'll need to use a three-step process:

1) We will use the `createElement()` method to create a new element that can then be added to the page. When this node is created, it will be *empty*. This element will be stored in a variable.
2) We will then add content to the element using the `innerHTML` or `textContent` properties we learned in the last unit.
3) Now that our element has been created, we can add it as a child of an element using the `appendChild()` method. This will add an element as the last child of the parent element.

To add a fourth item to our list, we can execute the following code:

```js
// First up, let's create a new list item and store it in a variable.
var newListItem = document.createElement('li');

// Alright! Now let's update the text content of that list item.
newListItem.textContent = 'Feed the cat';

// And, finally, let's add that list item as a child of the ul.
document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].appendChild(newListItem);


```

It involves a few steps, but you'll get the hang of it in no time!

### Getting and Setting Attributes

We might also want to update styles and attributes for elements on a page. We can do so using the following properties and methods:

####`className`
We can change the value of a class attribute for an element using the `className` property. This will apply any styles in our CSS associated with that particular class.

For example, maybe we want to highlight an important task in our list. We can add a class and styles in our CSS like so:

```css
.highlight {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```

Then, we can use JavaScript to add this class:

```js
document.getElementById('important').className = 'highlight';

```

The `.highlight` class will then be added to the element with the id `important`, along with the background-color associated with the class.

####`setAttribute()`, `removeAttribute()`

We can set and remove attributes from elements using the `setAttribute()` and `removeAttribute()` methods.

For example, if we want to update the `href` attribute on an anchor, we could do the following:

```js
document.getElementsByTagName('a')[0].setAttribute('href', 'http://newurl.com');

```

Or, if we wanted to remove the id from an element, we could execute this code:

```js
document.getElementsByTagName('a')[0].removeAttribute('id');

```


#Events

In order to create interactive and responsive sites, we'll often want to update the DOM based on a user's actions. For example, when a user clicks on the menu icon, a sidebar menu should slide out from the side of the page. Or, if a user has typed an incorrect format into a form field, the field should be outlined in red as he or she tabs out of the field. These actions are called **events**.

We can set up **event handlers** in our scripts that will listen, or wait, for an event to occur and then trigger a function.

The syntax for setting up an event handler looks like this:

```js
  element.addEventListener('nameOfEvent', functionToRun);
```
* `element` refers to the DOM node to which we want to tie the event. For example, if we want to trigger an event when a user clicks on a button, the element would be that button element.

* `.` ties the method on the right-hand side (`addEventListener`) with the element on the left-hand side.

* `addEventListener()` is the method we'll use to tie an event listener to an element.

* `'nameOfEvent'` is name of the event we want to listen for. For example, we may want to wait until a user triggers a 'click' event on an element.

* `'functionToRun'` is name of the function we want to run when the event occurs.

Let's take a look at an example:

```js
// Here, let's set up a function that will be triggered when the event occurs.
var alertUser = function () {
	alert('Button has been clicked!');
}

// Next, let's find the element to which we want to tie the event, and save it to a variable.
var button = document.querySelector('button');

// Finally, let's set up an event handler. When a user clicks on the button, the alertUser function will run.
button.addEventListener('click', alertUser);

```

##Types of Events

There are many events that can be used to trigger a function. Let's take a look at a few:

|  Event      |  Description  |
|:-------:    |:-------:|
| 'click'      | When a button (usually a mouse button) is pressed and released on a single element.  |
| 'keydown'     | When the user first presses a key on the keyboard.  |
| 'keyup'   | When the user releases a key on the keyboard.    |
| 'focus'     | When an element has received focus.   |
| 'blur'     | When an element loses focus.   |
| 'submit'   | When the user submits a form.  |
| 'load'   | When the page has finished loading. |
| 'resize'      | When the browser window has been resized.  |
| 'scroll'      | When the user scrolls up or down on the page. |


Let's take a look at a practical example. We've created a simple form for users to subscribe to our email newsletter. When a user tabs or clicks away from the email input field, we want to check to make sure that he or she has entered a value.

The HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>To-Do List</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>

	<form>
		<h1>Email Form</h1>
		<input id="email" type="email" placeholder="Email Address">
		<button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
		<p id="message"></p>
	</form>


</body>
</html>

```

Our CSS:

```css
.error {
	border: 1px solid #fa4542;
}
```

Now for our JavaScript:

```js  
// First, let's find the email input field.
var emailInputField = document.getElementById('email');

// Next up, let's set up a function to run when the event occurs.
var checkEmailInput = function () {

	// Check to see whether or not the user has entered a value to the email field.
	if (emailInputField.value.length === 0) {
		// If the email field is blank, display a message to the user.
		document.getElementById('message').innerText = 'Please enter an email address.'

		// Add an error class to the input field that will give it a red border.
		emailInputField.className = 'error';
	} else {
		//Otherwise, clear out the error message.
		document.getElementById('message').innerText = '';

		// Remove the error class from the input field.
		emailInputField.className = '';
	}

}

// Finally, let's add our event handler that will trigger the function when the user
// hits tab or clicks out of the email field (the 'blur' event).

emailInputField.addEventListener('blur', checkEmailInput);
```


Let's take a look at what the page now looks like after the user hits tab or clicks away from the email field:

##Conclusion
This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DOM manipulation and event handling. But hopefully it's gotten you excited about making your websites interactive and responsive. There are so many methods and functions to keep track of in the beginning that it can seem a little overwhelming. But don't feel like you have to sit down and memorize everything right now. Instead, focus on understanding the big picture, and memorization will come with practice.
