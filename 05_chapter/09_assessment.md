# Unit 5 Homework: Organizing Code and Creating Dynamic HTML

Your code is slowly but surely starting to get more robust. To better organize the code you've already written, as well as prepare for the code you will write, now, we will take the time to structure the program using functions. Further, using what you've learned about iterating with loops, you will also dynamically create your cards into HTML.

JavaScript comes with several "built-in" functions that we can call on using dot notation. These functions are no different than the functions we just covered, but they are more commonly known as _methods_.

For example, let's look at `document.createElement('div')` which creates an HTML `div` element (a `div` will come to visually represent a card in the browser).

- `document` is a readily available JS object. (An object is basically an associative array It stores key-value pairs, and unlike arrays, is not ordered).  
- `createElement` is the method it comes with
  - This method performs the functionality of creating a new HTML element.
  - Just like with the functions we've learned about, we can pass in arguments for these methods to use.

In this case, we passed `createElement` and argument of `'div'` so a `div` element is created. If you'd like, you can go ahead and run that line of code, `document.createElement('div')`, in your browser's console to get see it in action.

Besides `createElement`, the `document` object comes with other methods that help with the creation and manipulation of HTML and CSS. For example, there is a method for adding a class to an element, [`className`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className), as well as one for adding innerHTML, [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML). On top of those methods that allow you to construct an element, there's also the method [`appendChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) that aids in attaching the element to an element on your web page.

To complete this assignment, you will need to utilize these methods.

>**Note:** In order to append your card elements, you're going to need something to append to, in this case a `div` with the class `board`. In order to find an element to you want to append to, use JavaScript's `document` object to run the method [`getElementsByClassName`](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementsbyclassname.asp).

## Exercise

#### Requirements

###### Create the HTML for the cards:

- Find an element with the class name `board` and set it to a variable
- Assuming your memory card game consists of four cards, create a `for loop` that makes an HTML element for each card
  - each HTML element should be a `div`
  - each element should have a class `card` (this will help when you add CSS)
- Append each newly created card to the `div` that has the class `board`

###### Create functions to organize your code:

- create a function called `createBoard` that creates the HTML for your cards and appends the resulting HTML to your `div` that has the class board
- execute/fire your `createBoard` function so it runs

#### Below are the steps to complete the assignment.

1) Find the board and set it equal to a variable. See below.

```js
var board = document.getElementsByClassName('board')[0];
```

2) Create a `for loop` that will iterate four times. No hints here!


3) Create the required HTML for each card on each iteration and append this HTML to the board - add this logic inside the `for loop`. See below for hint.

```js

  // create a div element which will be used as a card
  var cardElement = document.createElement('div');

  // add a class to the card element which will help link styling
  cardElement.className = 'card';

  // append the card to the board
  board.appendChild(cardElement);

}
```

4) Create a `createBoard` function.

5) Add your board creation logic to the function from steps 1, 2 & 3.

6) Execute the `createBoard` function.

#### Deliverable

Once you're happy with your work, save your code and make a commit to your project's repository.
