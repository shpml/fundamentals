# Hello Bootstrap

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

From wikipedia:

 > Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It aims to ease the development of dynamic websites and web applications. As of June 2015, it was the most-starred project on GitHub, with over 81,000 stars and more than 32,000 forks.


Let's practice Twitter bootstrap during this lab.

Get the [starter-code](starter-code) containing a Rails app.

Run `rake db:migrate` to get the database up and running, `bundle` to install the gems, open the starter-code in sublime, and then start the Rails app. You should see a basic set of templates without any styling.

The goal of this exercise is to for you to explore and practice Twitter-bootstrap, you will find below some screenshots of the final result.  Bootstrap's documentation is _fantastic_ - take a look at all the things you can do.  

There is a bit of configuration that needs to happen before you can start using Bootstrap, so be sure to take a peek at the tutorial and make the necessary modifications to your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` and `Gemfile`.


## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Make this app responsive (`container-fluid`)
- Add a navbar at the top
- Style the index to represent the list of posts
- Style the new page to use all the width within the form
- Style the show page to render a post like in the screenshot

**Bonus:**
- Try to add some Twitter bootstrap themes, search for "bootstrap theme" on Google.
- Put the form in a modal window

#### Starter code

The [starter-code](starter-code) contains a Rails app with Post and Comment models: a post has many comments and comments for a post are added on the `posts/show` page.

#### Deliverable

Please find below some screenshots of the final app. You do not have to get exactly the same result, but the goal with this lab is to get you used to using and exploring bootstrap, the grid system, and the different CSS classes included with it.
