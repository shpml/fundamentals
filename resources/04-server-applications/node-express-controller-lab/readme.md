# Express RESTful controller practice lab

## Introduction

Practice makes perfect!  Imagine you work at an ECommerce site, and your boss is looking to build an internal API - that designers will eventually build on top of - to help track orders. To do this, you'll create another API using Express and Mongoose with nested documents.

## Exercise

#### Requirements


- Use Express and Body-parser.
- Use Moongoose and create:
  - A Model User
    - Name(String)
    - Gender(String)
    - Dob(Date)
  - A Model product
    - Name(String)
    - Price(Float)
    - Description(String)
  - A Model Order
    - Price(String)
    - CreatedAt(Date)
    - Adress(Object)
      - Street(String)
      - Postcode(String)
      - Town(String)
      - Country(String)
    - Products(Array of Product references)
    - User(Embedded User)
- Each resource should have a corresponding controller. For each resource, you should be able to reach the 5 routes (index, show, create, update and delete) using curl and add the references through curl
- Please write down the CRUD commands you've used to ensure your app is working.
- Each controller should be in a separate file.


**Bonus:**
- Create another resource address and reference it inside order instead of using nested
- Add validations to the schema and return the error message when validation fails

#### Starter code


You can re-use the app from yesterday. This lab include a starter code.


#### Deliverable

We've added some cURL commands below so that you can see if your app is working as expected:

-  `Index` cURL Request
  - Users: `curl http://localhost:3000/users`
  - Orders: `curl http://localhost:3000/orders`
  - Products: `curl http://localhost:3000/products`

- `Show` cURL Request
  - Users: `curl http://localhost:3000/users/55afa1f30eb92a607ab9e5c4`
  - Orders: `curl http://localhost:3000/orders/55af7b933b1fa385546c05c4`

  >Note: _Replace ID with the appropriate ID_

- `Create` cURL Request - create a order, a user, and a product:

  ```bash
  # order
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{  
    "price":   "14.23",
    "releaseDate":  "2015/07/22",
    "products" : [{
      "name" : "Headphones",
      "price" : "39.99",
      "description": "These in-ear headphones are a great accompaniment to a smartphone or mobile device. An inline control with microphone answers/ends calls, controls music/media playback and the volume level on compatible smartphones. Generously equipped with a carry pouch, XS/S/M/L eartips and S/M/L C tips for a comfortable fit. "
    },{
      "name" : "Apple iPod Touch 16GB 5th Generation - Pink",
      "price" : 149.00,
      "description": "iPod touch is more fun than ever. It has an ultrathin design, a 4-inch Retina display, iOS 7, Siri, iMessage, FaceTime, iTunes and the App Store, iTunes Radio, and more."
    }],
    "delivery_address": {
      "street": "68 hanbury street",
      "postcode": "nw6 1dp",
      "country": "United Kingdom"
    }
  }' http://localhost:3000/orders

  # user
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{  
    "name":   "Gerry",
    "gender":  "M",
    "dob" : "2015/03/23"
  }' http://localhost:3000/users

  # product
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "name":   "Ipod",
    "price":  "149.99",
    "description" : "this is a revolution"
  }' http://localhost:3000/products
  ```

-  `Update` cURL Request - update each model, too

  ```bash

  #order
  curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"price":   "188.99"}' http://localhost:3000/orders/55af7e96e8c3145759f70973/edit

  # user
  curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jay"}' http://localhost:3000/users/55afa1f30eb92a607ab9e5c4/edit

  # product
  curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"price":   "8888.99"}' http://localhost:3000/products/55afc24f104f09d08ab40ccb/edit
  ```

    >Note: _Replace ID with the appropriate ID_



- `Delete` cURL Request for each model


  ```bash

  # user
  curl -XDELETE http://localhost:3000/users/55afa1f30eb92a607ab9e5c4

  # order
  curl -XDELETE http://localhost:3000/orders/55af7b933b1fa385546c05c4

  # product
  curl -XDELETE http://localhost:3000/products/55afb742104f09d08ab40cca

  ```
