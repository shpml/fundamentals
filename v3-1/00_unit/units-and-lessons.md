* Every unit has **objectives** at the beginning. These are the learning goals you should be able to accomplish by the end of that unit.  It's always a good idea to circle back to the objectives and self-assess!

* Each lesson covers a topic related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or developer tools. Lessons are structured with explanations and plenty of examples to help you grasp these topics. You may have seen some of this material before, but we encourage you to do all of the exercises and assignments to really internalize the skills and vocabulary.
